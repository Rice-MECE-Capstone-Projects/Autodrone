# Heyu Wang ELEC 594 AutoDrone Capstone project


# Autonomous Drone Project, Fall 2022, Rice University
This repository contains the scripts for an autonomous drone project developed for Rice University ELEC 594. The project includes three main folders:

**Drone Hover Script**: 
contains the script for the drone to hover in the air.


**Script to Detect and Fly**: 
includes the scripts for the drone to fly towards a flower and perform some operations.


**Drone Simulation**:
contains the scripts to simulate the drone behavior in the SITL simulation environment.


To run the scripts, please follow the instructions in the README.md file inside each folder.

Results
According to the simulation I tested, the autonomous drone was able to successfully fly, and perform the required operations. The simulation results showed that the drone was able to navigate accurately in the simulated environment.
