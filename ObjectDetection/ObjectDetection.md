The VisDrone Dataset serves as an extensive benchmark aimed at advancing drone-based image
and video analysis. This dataset is particularly suited for
research due to its use of drone-mounted cameras, which
capture diverse conditions. The focus of the dataset is on 10
vehicle classes, encompassing a variety of scenarios such as
sparse and densely populated areas, under varying weather and
lighting conditions. These features make the VisDrone Dataset
a robust tool for developing and testing advanced analytic
techniques in the field of drone-operated imagin
